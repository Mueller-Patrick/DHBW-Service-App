# DHBW-Service-App

## Introduction
This is a project by three students of the Cooperative State University in Karlsruhe (DHBW Karlsruhe).
The goal is to develop a native iOS app providing easy and straightforward access to services like RaPla, Dualis and the canteen plan.

<b>Disclaimer:</b> This project is not affiliated with the DHBW Karlsruhe

## Build it yourself
As the app is not yet available on the App Store, you can build and install it yourself if you have a Mac with Xcode installed.
Just clone the repository, then open the project in Xcode and navigate to the project settings. In the target section, select
the iOS target. Then you have to select your own development team in the dropdown or create a new one.
If you completed these steps, you should be able to install a development version of the app on your own devices.
